#+title: Unmanaged MacOS Configuration

I'm grateful that Nix is able to configure so much of my systems, both Linux and
MacOS included. However, the [[nix-darwin][Nix-darwin]] project can only go so far. The rest
requires manual configuration. This folder contains what little is left for me.

I don't want to make this document a giant list of things all the settings I set
manually. Nix manages most things that matter. Everything else is either
frivolous, or changes too dynamically to care to capture.

If something important comes up that I don't want to forget, I'll document it
here.
