#+title: Unmanaged Configuration
#+setupfile: ../doc/internal/links.org

I'm grateful that Nix is able to configure so much of my systems, both Linux and
MacOS included. However, projects like [[nix-darwin][Nix-darwin]] can only go so far. The rest
requires manual configuration. This folder contains what little is left for me.

I don't want to make this document a giant list of things all the settings I set
manually. Nix manages most things that matter. Everything else is either
frivolous, or changes too dynamically to care to capture.

Here's a miscellaneous configuration that didn't have a better place:

- the "notify-time" script won't work until "terminal-notifier" is enabled in
  "System Preferences -> Notifications."

I'll put more here as they come.
