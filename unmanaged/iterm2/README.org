#+title: Unmanaged MacOS iTerm2 Configuration

Most of the configuration of iTerm2 that I require is in profiles. iTerm2 has a
GUI for exporting and importing profiles. This [[./Profiles.json][./Profiles.json]] file is an
untouched export from that interface.

Other settings that I recall setting:
- General: tmux: ☑️ Automatically bury the tmux session after connecting
- Advanced: Close tmux windows after detaching? Yes

Those are most useful for me. I may have set others and forgotten.
