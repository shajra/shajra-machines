#+title: Unmanaged MacOS iTerm2 Configuration

There's two configurations in iTerm that support an export/import options:

- Settings → Keys (use [[./shajra.itermkeymap][shajra.itermkeymap]])
- Settings → Profiles (use [[./Profiles.json][Profiles.json]]}

Most configuration of iTerm2 that I require is in profiles. The keymap most
importantly passes through Cmd+Enter as an escaped Enter, which works for Vim
and Emacs.

Other settings that I recall setting:
- General: tmux: ☑️ Automatically bury the tmux session after connecting
- Advanced: Close tmux windows after detaching? Yes

Those are most useful for me. I may have set others and forgotten.
