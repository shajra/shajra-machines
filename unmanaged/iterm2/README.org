#+title: Unmanaged MacOS iTerm2 Configuration

There's some configuration in iTerm that support export/import options. Most
import for are iTerm2 profiles:

- Settings → Profiles (use [[./Profiles.json][Profiles.json]]}

Other settings that I recall setting:
- General: tmux: ☑️ Automatically bury the tmux session after connecting
- Advanced: Close tmux windows after detaching? Yes

Those are most useful for me. I may have set others and forgotten.
