Normally we specify directory local variables with “.dir-local.el” files. But
with this function we can specify these variables programmatically in our Emacs
configuration/initialization files. This function wraps
‘dir-locals-set-class-variables’ and ‘dir-locals-set-directory-class’, which are
a touch more verbose to use directly.

DIR is a directory name as a string. MODE is a major mode symbol (use ‘nil’ for
all major-modes). ALIST is an alist associating variables with their settings.

See ‘+dir-locals-set-dirs-locals’ for a function to set variables for multiple
directories at once."

alist associating directory names to the alist associating variables to their
