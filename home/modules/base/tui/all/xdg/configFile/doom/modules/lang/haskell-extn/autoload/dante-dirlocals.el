  "Set ‘dante-target’ and other directory local variables.

Setting directory-local variables with “.dir-local.el” files can be tedious.
With this function we can set them programmatically.

This function only specifies these variables only for ‘haskell-mode’. See
‘+dir-locals-set-dirs-locals’ for a more general function.

TARGETS is an alist associating directory names to the setting of
‘dante-target’. BASELOCALS is an alist of other directory-local settings to
include for all directories associated in TARGETS."
